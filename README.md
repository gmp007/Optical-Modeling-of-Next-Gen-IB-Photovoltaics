# Optical-Modeling-of-Next-Gen-IB-Photovoltaics

## Introduction

Intermediate band (IB) photovoltaics is the next generation in solar cell technology where the solar cell active layer is made of an IB semiconductor. Here, we have computationally modelled such a thin-film solar cell where the active layer is copper (Cu) intercalated heterostructure of GeSe/SnS, i.e CuGeSe/SnS. Our computations reveal high external quantum efficiencies, as large as 190%, for a wide range of solar wavelengths.

## Methods

The modeling of the thin-film solar cell is done using the numerically exact transfer matrix method, with the complex refractive index of the active layer obtained by solving the Bethe-Salpeter equations.
